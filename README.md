# Change files names

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for renaming multiple files within a selected folder. The program utilizes the Tkinter module to create the GUI, and the os and filedialog modules to interact with the operating system and select the folder.

The script creates a Tkinter window with a label displaying the current default folder, a button to select a different folder, and a button to execute the renaming process. It also includes an author label at the bottom of the window. The mainloop() function is called at the end of the script to launch the GUI and enable user interaction.
